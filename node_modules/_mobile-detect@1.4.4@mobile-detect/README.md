# mobile-detect.js

A loose port of [Mobile-Detect](https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect) to JavaScript.

This script will detect the device by comparing patterns against a given User-Agent string.
You can find out information about the device rendering your web page:

  * mobile or not
  * if mobile, whether phone or tablet
  * operating system
  * [Mobile Grade (A, B, C)](https://jquerymobile.com/browser-support/) **REMARK: this is completely outdated: all current devices will return an 'A', so it's useless nowadays**
  * specific versions (e.g. WebKit)

Current `master` branch is using detection logic from **Mobile-Detect@2.8.34**

# Live Demo

Demo/check (sorry about the missing styling) can be found [here](https://hgoebl.github.io/mobile-detect.js/check/).

# Warning

**TL;DR: you should not use this library in your HTML page and it's less reliable when used server-side (Node.js)**

As mentioned later, "User-Agent" based detection is **not a reliable solution** in most cases, because:

  * The rules (regular expressions) are constantly out-dated and incomplete
  * You have to update the detection code continuously
  * There are other ways to detect how your web application should behave:
    * feature detection, e.g. [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/)
    * [Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries), examples at <https://mediaqueri.es/>
  * Maybe there are some libraries out there (which are probably not free) doing a more reliable job

If you still want to (or have to) use this library, you should always **encapsulate it with your own code**,
because chances a very high that you have to tweak the behaviour a bit or are not satisfied with the
result of mobile-detect.js. **Don't spread usage of MobileDetect all over your own code!** As you can see
in the issues, there are some "bugs", feature-requests, pull-requests where people are not so happy
how MobileDetect works. But I cannot change its behaviour from version to version, even if this was
reasonable from new users' point of view. I hope you show understanding.

At least there is a way to monkey-patch the library (see "Extending" below).

# Usage

## Browser

```html
<script src="mobile-detect.js"></script>
<script>
    var md = new MobileDetect(window.navigator.userAgent);
    // ... see below
</script>
```

## Node.js / Express

```js
var MobileDetect = require('mobile-detect'),
    md = new MobileDetect(req.headers['user-agent']);
// ... see below
```

## General

```js
var md = new MobileDetect(
    'Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 4.0.3; en-in; SonyEricssonMT11i' +
    ' Build/4.1.A.0.562) AppleWebKit/534.30 (KHTML, like Gecko)' +
    ' Version/4.0 Mobile Safari/534.30');

// more typically we would instantiate with 'window.navigator.userAgent'
// as user-agent; this string literal is only for better understanding

console.log( md.mobile() );          // 'Sony'
console.log( md.phone() );           // 'Sony'
console.log( md.tablet() );          // null
console.log( md.userAgent() );       // 'Safari'
console.log( md.os() );              // 'AndroidOS'
console.log( md.is('iPhone') );      // false
console.log( md.is('bot') );         // false
console.log( md.version('Webkit') );         // 534.3
console.log( md.versionStr('Build') );       // '4.1.A.0.562'
console.log( md.match('playstation|xbox') ); // false
```

## More Info ...

There is some documentation generated by JSDoc:

<https://hgoebl.github.io/mobile-detect.js/doc/MobileDetect.html>

## Side Effects

Script creates the global property `MobileDetect`.

## Modernizr Extension

When using [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/), you can include `mobile-detect-modernizr.js`.
It will add the CSS classes `mobile`, `phone`, `tablet` and `mobilegradea` if applicable.

You can easily extend it, e.g. `android`, `iphone`, etc.

# Extending/Modifying Behaviour

Though it is not recommended to rely on internal methods or structures of MobileDetect, you can alter
the behaviour by replacing particular internal methods with your own implementations.
If you feel like this is the only possibility, then go ahead and have a look at the source code and
examples in tests/spec/MobileDetectSpec.js (search for "Extensibility").

# Alternatives / Infos

Often device detection is the first solution in your mind. Please consider looking for other solutions
like media queries and feature detection (e.g. w/ Modernizr). Maybe there are better (simpler, smaller,
faster) device detection libraries, so here you have a list (order has no meaning apart from first element):

  * REMARK: this list might be outdated - please tell me about alternatives!
  * [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/)
    In most cases the better solution: don't use knowledge about device and version, but detect features
    (touch, canvas, ...)

  * [Mobile-Detect](https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect)
    A lightweight PHP class for detecting mobile devices (including tablets).
    This is the "source" of this JavaScript project and if you use PHP on your server you should use it!
  * [Detect Mobile Browsers](http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/) Open source mobile phone detection in many languages
    and for Webservers (Apache, nginx, IIS). mobile-detect.js uses the code of this library as a fallback in case
    of incomplete detection regular expressions.

  * [dmolsen/Detector](https://github.com/dmolsen/Detector)
    Detector is a simple, PHP- and JavaScript-based browser- and
    feature-detection library that can adapt to new devices & browsers
    on its own without the need to pull from a central database of browser information.

## Mobile-Usage Statistics

If you have to provide statistics about how many and which mobile devices are hitting your web-site, you can
generate statistics (data and views) with [hgoebl/mobile-usage](https://github.com/hgoebl/mobile-usage).
There are many hooks to customize statistical calculation to your needs.

# Contributing

Your contribution is welcome.
If you want new devices to be supported, please contribute to
[Mobile-Detect](https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect) instead.

To run generate-script it is necessary to have [Mobile-Detect](https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect)
as a sibling directory to mobile-detect.js/.
(I tried to use `git subtree` but had some problems on Mac OS X - probably my fault...)

  * fork or clone serbanghita/Mobile-Detect
  * fork hgoebl/mobile-detect.js
  * run `npm install`
  * create branch
  * make changes and run `grunt` (needs PHP >= 5.4 in your path)
  * run browser test (tests/SpecRunner.html)
  * commit, push to your branch
  * create pull request

## Testing

    $ # or
    $ grunt jasmine_node


# Donations

If you want, you can donate to [Mobile-Detect](https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect).


# TODO
